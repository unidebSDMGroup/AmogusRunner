## IV . Screen Plans

This section covers early concepts regarding the general look and aesthetic of the game.
After all the major pieces were conceptualized, they were all complied in a screen plan shown below.
The overall concept and asset creation were approached satirically;
In essence, small parts were suggested and added to reinforce this idea.

A few of these parts could be seen in the game background.
The background was designed to be static and it includes faraway rocks and mounds
as seen in the original among us map " Polus".
The faraway standing figures are part of an online joke and their presence is purely comical.

The animation was planned to be simple considering the scope and simplicity of the Game.
Two of the planned major keyframes are shown below. Other keyframes will be created to smooth the animation.

Below is a reference of the two Main characters. They have very similar design with different colors.
The hand was added comically to enforce the idea of a chase.

The platform of the game will be composed of 4 different fixed sized blocks. these blocks will be
spawn in a random order. As such, extra care needs to be put on the boarders of the individual blocks
to ensure that any block could continue any other without breaking the illusion of continuity.
The platform needed to be completely flat, yet the blocks themselves will contain minor transparent parts near the surface which shouldn't affect the running mechanics.
 this choice was purely aesthetic and non-technical.
The Polus map included a lava pool therefore some blocks have a pool of lava below.

With everything above put together, the screenplan is as follows.
It Background color was intentionally darker to separate it from the foreground and a gradient was used to color the sky.
