# Requirement Specification

## I. Current Situation

Endless games are one of the most popular video games where people try to do their best and get the highest score. That's why we aim to develop an among us themed endless runner game since this theme is still popular among people, but unlike its original version in our game, there are two characters where one of them is chasing the other that adds extra excitement to the game.

## II. Dream System

Our main development goal is to create a satirical amongus themed runner that keeps the player engaged to achieve a high score. It will be an endless runner / jumper, meaning the map will be moving from right to left. the player will be stationary ( even though it displays running animation ) The user has to control the character by using a key and that is jumping., In order to jump higher the user presses it twice. The user main goal here is to chase an AI based secondary character that will be able to jump. The user needs to catch up. It he doesn't under a certain limit it will result in game over and he have to restart again.

## III. Current Processes

In most of the endless games like Temple Run, Subway Surfers and Super Mario; main goal is to achieve the highest score possible. In order to achieve that players must overcome obstacles by jumping and they must do this in haste as the game goes faster the longer it goes, if the player is unable to overcome these challenges game will prompt the player with a game over screen.
