# Current situation:

Endless games are one of the most popular video games where people try to do their best and get the highest score. That's why we aim to develop an among us themed endless runner game since this theme is still popular among people,  but unlike its original version in our game, there are two characters where one of them is chasing the other that adds extra excitement to the game.

# Dream Situation:

our main development goal is to create a satirical amongus themed runner that keeps the player engaged to achieve a high score. It will be an endless runner / jumper, meaning the map will be moving from right to left. the player will be stationary ( even tho it displays running animation ) The user has to controll the character by using a key and that is jumping., In order to jump higher the user presses it twice. The user main goal here is to chase an AI based secondary character that will be able to jump. The user needs to catch up. It he doesnt under a certain limit it will result in game over and he have to restart again.
